## FeVAcS: FEniCS Visualizing Acoustic Scattering

FeVAcS is an open-source finite element software designed to streamline exterior acoustic analyses, particularly for scenarios involving multiple obstacles arranged periodically. It facilitates lattice placement parameters, mesh generation, variational formulation, and the display of contour plots for the results. The software also offers a browser-based solution display, enhancing the ease of sharing and comprehending this complex physical phenomenon.

## Installation

To install a FEniCS container that is compatible with Jupyter Notebook and has all the other libraries required to run FeVAcS installed, refer to the Instructions.md file.
